# SWAPI
SWAPI Project for FlightHub

Before running use yarn on both client, server and base root.

How to run: Client
1. cd my-app 
2. yarn start

Server:
1. cd server
2. yarn start

It might also fail on the server end if you dont do : yarn add cross-fetch. So make sure to do this as well! 

Info: This is a React app that uses the Staw Wars API to generate a list of people, planets and starships. Aditionally it allows you to pull up an individual person and search the site for people.

It also uses express endpoints in the server.

Happy coding!
