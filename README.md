# SWAPI
SWAPI Project for FlightHub

How to run: Client
1. cd my-app 
2. yarn start

Server:
1. cd server

Info: This is a React app that uses the Staw Wars API to generate a list of people, planets and starships. Aditionally it allows you to pull up an individual person and search the site for people.

It also uses express endpoints in the server.

Happy coding!
